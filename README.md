## Project Architecture & Flow

The system is composed of:
- **User Interface (Frontend):** Modern, responsive chat and job browsing experience.
- **API Gateway (Backend Controller Layer):** Receives and routes user requests.
- **Intent Detection:** Classifies user messages to determine their intent (job search, resume advice, etc.).
- **AI Services:** Specialized services for job matching, resume analysis, job detail analysis, general Q&A, and interview simulation.
- **Database:** Stores user profiles, job data, and interview sessions.
- **External LLM Provider:** Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) powers the agent's intelligence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Java 21
- MongoDB instance (local or remote)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 1. Backend (Spring Boot API)

#### Option A: Running directly with Gradle

```bash
cd job-agent-api
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
```

- The backend will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.
- Configure your MongoDB and Azure OpenAI credentials in the appropriate config files or environment variables (see .env.example for reference).

#### Option B: Running with Docker Compose

```bash
cd job-agent-api

cp .env.example .env

nano .env 
docker-compose up -d
```

- This will start the Spring Boot application along with MongoDB instances.
- The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- All required services will be containerized and networked together.

### 2. Frontend (React App)

```bash
cd jobagent
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The frontend will start on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
- Make sure the backend is running for full functionality.
